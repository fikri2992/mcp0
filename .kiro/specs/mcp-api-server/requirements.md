# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a basic Model Context Protocol (MCP) server in TypeScript that enables calling external APIs. The MCP server will provide a standardized interface for making HTTP requests to various APIs, handling authentication, and returning structured responses. This will allow AI assistants and other MCP clients to interact with external services through a consistent protocol.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create an MCP server that can make HTTP API calls, so that I can integrate external services into MCP-compatible applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server is initialized THEN it SHALL register available API calling tools
2. WHEN a client requests available tools THEN the server SHALL return a list of supported HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
3. WHEN the server receives a tool call request THEN it SHALL validate the required parameters (URL, method, headers, body)
4. IF the request parameters are invalid THEN the server SHALL return an appropriate error message
5. WHEN making an API call THEN the server SHALL support common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user of the MCP server, I want to make authenticated API calls, so that I can access protected endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making an API call THEN the server SHALL support custom headers for authentication
2. WHEN authentication headers are provided THEN the server SHALL include them in the HTTP request
3. WHEN no authentication is provided THEN the server SHALL make unauthenticated requests
4. IF authentication fails THEN the server SHALL return the authentication error from the API

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the MCP server, I want to receive structured responses from API calls, so that I can process the data effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API call is successful THEN the server SHALL return the response body, status code, and headers
2. WHEN an API call fails THEN the server SHALL return error details including status code and error message
3. WHEN the response is JSON THEN the server SHALL parse and return it as structured data
4. WHEN the response is not JSON THEN the server SHALL return it as text
5. WHEN a network error occurs THEN the server SHALL return a descriptive error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to handle different content types, so that I can work with various API formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending a POST or PUT request THEN the server SHALL support JSON request bodies
2. WHEN sending form data THEN the server SHALL support URL-encoded content
3. WHEN making requests THEN the server SHALL set appropriate Content-Type headers
4. WHEN receiving responses THEN the server SHALL handle different content types appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user of the MCP server, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the server SHALL log the error details
2. WHEN a request times out THEN the server SHALL return a timeout error
3. WHEN invalid JSON is provided THEN the server SHALL return a JSON parsing error
4. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL log successful initialization
5. WHEN the server receives requests THEN it SHALL log request details for debugging
