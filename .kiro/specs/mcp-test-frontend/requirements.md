# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides a local web-based frontend for testing MCP (Model Context Protocol) server functionality. The frontend will allow developers to interact with their MCP server through a user-friendly HTML interface, making it easier to test tools, validate responses, and debug server behavior during development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple web interface to connect to my local MCP server, so that I can test server functionality without needing complex tooling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the HTML file THEN the system SHALL display a connection form with server URL input
2. WHEN the user enters a valid MCP server URL THEN the system SHALL attempt to establish a connection
3. IF the connection is successful THEN the system SHALL display a success message and enable tool testing features
4. IF the connection fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with connection details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see all available tools from my MCP server, so that I can understand what functionality is exposed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connected to an MCP server THEN the system SHALL fetch and display all available tools
2. WHEN displaying tools THEN the system SHALL show tool names, descriptions, and parameter schemas
3. WHEN a tool has parameters THEN the system SHALL display the parameter types and requirements
4. WHEN no tools are available THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute MCP tools with custom parameters, so that I can test their functionality and validate responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a tool THEN the system SHALL display a form with input fields for all required parameters
2. WHEN the user fills in parameters and clicks execute THEN the system SHALL send the tool request to the MCP server
3. WHEN the tool execution is successful THEN the system SHALL display the response in a readable format
4. WHEN the tool execution fails THEN the system SHALL display the error message and details
5. WHEN parameters are invalid THEN the system SHALL show validation errors before sending the request

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see request and response history, so that I can track my testing sessions and debug issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tool is executed THEN the system SHALL log the request and response to a history panel
2. WHEN viewing history THEN the system SHALL display timestamps, tool names, parameters, and responses
3. WHEN the user clicks on a history item THEN the system SHALL show the full request/response details
4. WHEN the user wants to clear history THEN the system SHALL provide a clear history button

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to visualize the overall MCP interaction flow, so that I can understand the complete communication between client and server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connected to an MCP server THEN the system SHALL display the MCP protocol handshake and initialization messages
2. WHEN tools are listed THEN the system SHALL show the tools/list request and response in the interaction log
3. WHEN a tool is executed THEN the system SHALL display the complete JSON-RPC request and response messages
4. WHEN viewing interactions THEN the system SHALL show message types, IDs, and full payloads in a structured format
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display the complete error response including error codes and messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the interface to be responsive and work without external dependencies, so that I can use it in any environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the HTML file is opened THEN the system SHALL work without internet connectivity
2. WHEN viewed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately
3. WHEN using the interface THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback for all actions
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
